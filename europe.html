      <h1>all about europe</h1>
<p class="paragraph">
  helooo so if you're here it's because you love Europe and would like to get to know more about it, or you're visiting and want to make the best out of it.<br><br>

I am here to help you while simultaneously trying to relive my best memories.... hope you have a great time and find something useful :)<br><br>

so I visited Europe 7 years back ( i know that's a looong time back) and i was 11 years old (got a lot of free tickets so if you have a kid under the ago of 12 you're saving bucks ;) ) .<br>
 It is a magnificent place. The thing about Europe is you find different things to marvel over every place you visit. <br><br>

Nothing is the same as the previous one and while visiting Europe you don't enjoy the exact tourist place. If you're like me you'll see that their lifestyle, their food, markets, the people and their general architecture is magnificent.<br><br> 

I'll be talking about the places the places visited, and what i did, that should help every candid traveler out there.</p>
